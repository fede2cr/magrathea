Experiments on our ways of doing seeds bombs

## What's a seed bomb

It's a technique that has been used around the world and popularized by Masanobu Fukuoka, and consists of putting one or more seeds in a protective casing and nutritional material to help the seed get a start on the germination process.

It has been used on a movement called guerrilla gardening to seed private underdeveloped properties  with flower seeds to improve urban areas.

Our research bibliography has revealed that Mr Fukuoka recommends adding seeds from different species and types of plants, as well as natural anti-fungal additives.

## Our version

At the moment this are some of the changes we are experimenting on:

### Egg cartons

Individual cells from egg cartons are being used as a simple to construct solution with recycled materials. Egg cartons, are designed to repel water for small amounts of time, but will soak it and release it very slowly if they are exposed to water to a period larger than a tens of seconds.

A sandwich of two egg carton cells is constructed by pressing to layers of egg carton together. Inside the sandwich we add one type of seed at first to test it's individual germination rate, and later with other plants that germinate in a similar time period.

The egg carton sandwich should maintain an appropriate level of moisture as well a retaining the sun's heat without damaging the seeds. Once the group of seeds starts to germinate it will push the sandwich apart and allow the roots to seek soil and cotiledons and young leafs to seek light as well as to allow several species of plants to test how well they adapt to the soil and light conditions.

Another unexpected advantage of using egg cartons is that it allows to put a crude stamp on the sides of the cell to create awareness of the project, and to explain what to do if you find a cell in your property or how to support the project.

### Multi-layer delivery

For damaged areas with bad soil and heavy sun exposure, multiple layers of the sandwich can be used to deliver a first dose of rapid germinating pioneer plants to provide coverage and initial soil reparation, and larger more delicate plants in other layers.

## Testing equipment

We use some precision instruments to measure germination conditions to help validate improvements in seed bomb development.

### Germination test rig

To test germination in egg carton and recycled carton we have build a germination rig so that we can test the germination rate and timing in a lab environment before deploying seeds bombs in the wild.

It consist of a 3d printer heat bed used as a heat source, and a PID controller for precise heat control. This is encased in a large plastic container where individual transparent plastic containers are added with different types of experiments and germination tests.

### Seed monitor rig

To validate how close are we in the lab to real world conditions, an environmental monitoring device will be constructed with a low power microcontroller and an inexpensive thermometer/humidity sensor to validate if temp/humidity conditions remain favorable for germination. It will report sensor conditions via wireless tecnology, either Wifi or LoRa depending on the range and how easy it is to retrieve the unit. For this will are using the Feather format from Adafruit.
