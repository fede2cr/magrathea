Robotic tools for reversing deforestation, improving biodiversity and forest managment

## Description

This project is about robotic assisted planting through seed bombs instead of germinated plants, delivered via drone through a regime of several years, utilizing clusters of existing plants to increase the perimeter of productive land. This tools can be used in desertification reversal, deforestation reversal, improving tertiary and secundary forests, and by increasing biodiversity on comercial forestry operations.

## Some basics

- Seed bombs

- Drone sowing and monitoring

- 4d forest printing

- Lack of external irrigation of any kind

## Monitoring and progress

## Protocol and test areas

## Species selection criteria

- Local: The surroundings to the test area are surveyed for native species that are quantified to generate a representation of the population to be planted. Seeds should be gattered from local trees and if not available from several mother trees instead of just one or a few. Non-native species are to be avoided and only allow in cases of severe damage which are not a concern in initial tests.

- Provides food to fauna: Flowers for hummingbirds, bats and butterflies; fruits for mammals and reptils.

- Provides food to human communities: Fruits and vegetables are planted near communities to provide with natural and free food.

- Increase biodiversity: Experiments to include more than seeds are in place with orquid seed trials, mychrorizae, worms, dung beetles and fern spores.
